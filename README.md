# ESDP1
Repository for the course "Earth System Data Processing 1" at the University of Cologne SOSE 2024.
During this curse we learned to handle large scale Earth System Data and how to process this data.

1. One of the tasks of the course was to develop procedures to support METFUT in donwloading and regridding data from the Copernicus Data Storage (CDS).
    
    You can find further information and the developed procedures in the METFUT_load_and_regrid_era5data.ipynb file.
